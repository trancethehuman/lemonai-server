# üçã Lemon AI Server

## About

**Lemon AI server to build powerful AI assistants in minutes and execute highly efficient workflow automations by accessing tools like Airtable, Hubspot, Slack and Github**

Most connectors available today are focused on read-only operations, limiting the potential of LLMs. Agents, on the other hand, have a tendency to hallucinate from time to time due to missing context or instructions.

With Lemon AI, it is possible to give your agents access to well-defined APIs for more reliable read-and-write operations. In addition, Lemon AI functions allow you to reduce the risk of hallucinations even more by providing a way to statically define workflows that the model can rely on in case of insecurity.

## ü¶æ Getting Started

To use Lemon AI in your Langchain application you need to have the Lemon AI server running. To get started please install all required dependencies first:

```bash
npm install
```

This will install the corresponding node modules.

To start the server run:

```bash
npm start
```

The terminal should indicate that the server is running:

```bash
App running under pid XXXXX and listening on port: 1313 in production mode
```
